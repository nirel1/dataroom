# What are the risks of the business?

### Regulatory cost for U.S. Compliance:
The cost to offer our services to the U.S. may cost millions of dollars and they may not even be suitable to regulators; which could result in us getting denied. We will work with our lawyers and make adjustments to the business model so we can meet all the criteria set for us. 

### Performance risk:
When you buy into a Mira index fund, you are buying a tokenized trading strategy that comes with its own set of performance risks. No trading strategy is guaranteed to make money and users should be aware of that when deciding if they want to buy and hold an Index. All of the performance metrics for each fund will be displayed on Mira Financeâ€™s website and are also visible on-chain.
