# What problems do you solve?

### Custody
Investment management means sacrificing custody. It makes sense in TradFi, but need not in Crypto. There should be a better solution to building investment funds without transferring ownership to a manager or entity.

### Transferability
Moving across applications is tedious - this leads to separation between tokens that are active (DeFi, governance, P2P), and those that are investments. If only users had a better way to engage their passive tokens without jumping around.

### Complexity
The Crypto user experience is convoluted. Users must keep track of gas fees, block generation, slippage, exchange rates, token types, bridging, and more. We make it simple.
