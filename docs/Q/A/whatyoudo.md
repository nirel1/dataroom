# What does your company do?

At Mira Finance, we:

### Create Index Fund Products: 
giving investors broad, diversified exposure to crypto assets on different chains - in one click.

### Host a Two-Sided Fund Marketplace: 
extending our protocol to investment managers to create their own funds and recruit investors, and to investors to research and deploy capital.

### Operate a one stop-shop: 
integrated with multi-wallet compatibility, fiat on-ramps, and DeFi strategies like staking and borrowing, so that users can make the most of their crypto without switching sites.
