# What is your target market and its size?

The addressable market for passive investment is huge, at about $11T, and is deeply underexposed to this new financial sector. 

We're not sure whether it will be large swathes of users, treasuries, banks, or high net worth individuals, but to succeed we need to capture only a small segment of one of these spaces. 

We believe that observing our users post launch will signal where we can pivot to focus our resources. 

Ultimately, our goal is to proliferate in the index and ETF space in the US. 

The US has some of the most active retail and institutional investment, and crypto index funds have yet to gain traction here. We're currently incorporated and planning to launch internationally, while we work on our legal side to establish presence in the US.
