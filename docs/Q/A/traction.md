# What traction have you received so far?

We won two hackathons: xHack, hosted by Wormhole and Jump Capital, and DoraHacks.

We built multiple fully functional smart contract modules, a fluid UX, an integrated dApp, and a backend server to manage off-chain data in less than two months. 

We’ve made partnerships with LayerZero, Axelar, Pontem, Notifi, and other players that streamline functionality for our protocol. 

We’ve built a strong community of beta users on our Discord (6k) and Twitter (8k).
