# How did you meet your co-founder?

My co-founder, Andrew, and I grew up in the same neighborhood. We were both into crypto pretty early, like to debate and research, and have a lot of opinions - as you can imagine, we've had our share of heated discussions and we've explored the weeds of many projects over the years. 

This past summer, we were both sharing our frustrations about crypto sentiment and retail exposure. It quickly dawned on us that we could take a stab at it ourselves. Mira Finance. We knew that this idea was the one, and we've been full-time, heads down working since then.
