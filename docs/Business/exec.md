# Executive Summary
Cryptocurrency has raised considerable interest for its potential to simplify the world's financial access, efficiency, and infrastructure as a whole. With US regulation on the horizon, digital assets are on the cusp of a transformation from speculative value to utility.

Fidelity found that over 73% of institutional investors plan to invest in digital assets and 52% of American adults are interested in having them in their retirement accounts. But with tens of thousands of digital assets to choose from, many don't know where to start. Mira aims to solve this with institutional grade index investments that provide broad exposure to the crypto market. Similar to the SPY in traditional finance, our thematic and market capitalization weighted indices will provide simple asset exposure so that investors don't have to choose. 

On our platform, managers can design and actively manage their own funds, recruiting investors and earning management fees in the process. We’re building a community of experts, fund managers, institutions, and aspiring traders that can research, learn, and manage their assets on a professional scale. 

We plan to launch a multi-audited platform with fully collateralized funds and regulatory compliance.

The team at Mira Finance is based in Washington DC and has prior experience in blockchain engineering, finance, and public policy. We’re combining our knowledge of digital assets to protect consumers, promote sound regulatory policy on Capitol Hill, and bring trust to the industry.
