# Revenue Streams
Our protocol is designed to collect on four main sources of revenue.

## Management Fees
All index funds (Layer1s, Wireless, DeFi, Gaming, NFTs, etc.) that Mira creates will charge a 0.95% management fee, collected yearly.

## Creation Fees
Investment Managers are charged a fee upon publishing their own fund - this can be charged as a fixed fee or as a percentage of their deposit.

## Investment Fees
Investors are charged a fee when they invest into any fund created by another user (not Mira) - this can be charged as a fixed fee or as a percentage of their deposit.

## Payment for Order Flow
Other DeFi protocols will pay to be integrated into our site in exchange for forwarded transaction volume. We expect this to be lucrative when usage on our platform increases.

## *
The smart contract is designed so that the Mira account (multi-sig wallet of founders) can update the creation and investment fees at any time. Similarly, the management fees charged for each Mira fund can be updated at any time. The maximum fee threshold (10%) is built into the contract and declared at module publication. Users consent to this when they first enter our website and sign our disclaimer. However, none of our fee collection is retroactive - fee changes only apply to future collections. Any adjustments will be announced at a minimum of 7 days prior to taking effect.
