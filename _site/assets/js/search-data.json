    "content": "Cryptocurrency has raised considerable interest for its potential to simplify the world’s financial access, efficiency, and infrastructure as a whole. With US regulation on the horizon, digital assets are on the cusp of a transformation from speculative value to utility. Fidelity found that over 73% of institutional investors plan to invest in digital assets and 52% of American adults are interested in having them in their retirement accounts. But with tens of thousands of digital assets to choose from, many don’t know where to start. Mira aims to solve this with institutional grade index investments that provide broad exposure to the crypto market. Similar to the SPY in traditional finance, our thematic and market capitalization weighted indices will provide simple asset exposure so that investors don’t have to choose. On our platform, managers can design and actively manage their own funds, recruiting investors and earning management fees in the process. We’re building a community of experts, fund managers, institutions, and aspiring traders that can research, learn, and manage their assets on a professional scale. We plan to launch a multi-audited platform with fully collateralized funds and regulatory compliance. The team at Mira Finance is based in Washington DC and has prior experience in blockchain engineering, finance, and public policy. We’re combining our knowledge of digital assets to protect consumers, promote sound regulatory policy on Capitol Hill, and bring trust to the industry. ",

    "content": "Building our own infrastructure to support index fund products was a big challenge, but it comes with a lot of perks. We have complete customizability from the top down, which makes it really easy to upgrade contracts for new user capabilities, product features, and plugging in other protocols like staking. Deep inside the infrastructure, we took a unique approach to designing the investment pools. For each pool that’s initialized, a resource account is created in the code, and funds are stored on that account. A ledger is created to keep track of investments into the pool, which are essentially token transfers to that non-human account. The only functions to interact with a pool are the highly protected invest() and withdraw(). Withdrawing relies on the balance stored in the ledger, which can only be updated by investing from a governed list of tokens. Naturally, the resource accounts and ledgers are not accessible. In other words, the token transfer processes are foolproof. This insulates any fund from being drained by a single account. What we expect to see is funds where some investments are never withdrawn, because users lose their keys - part of the trade-off of building complete self-custody for investors. Our protocol innovations allow us to design index funds where the manager can collect a fee, automate rebalancing, update their fund allocation, and set minimum withdrawal/contribution requirements without an ability to access any of the funds that are invested.
